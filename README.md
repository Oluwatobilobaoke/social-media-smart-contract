# Social Media Smart Contract

## Question 01

Develop a decentralized social media platform where users can create and share content in the form of NFTs representing multimedia assets such as images, videos, and audio clips. The platform should incorporate advanced features such as user authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), and content moderation.

## Features

Integrate an authentication mechanism to verify the identity of users.
Ensure you make use of factory contracts for the NFT creation features
All NFT interactions must be done via the social media contract.
Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions for different user roles.
Ensure that sensitive functions are only accessible to authorized users.
Implement the creation of groups/ communities on the platform
Implement features for users to discover and interact with content, including searching, and commenting on NFTs.
Implement a gasless transaction mechanism whereby users do not pay for gas while using the platform
Deploy to a testnet and ensure your contract is verified.
ALL FEATURES SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED WITH SOLIDITY (NO DAPP)

## Smart Contract

The smart contract is written in Solidity and is deployed on the Rinkeby testnet. The contract is verified and can be found [here](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x265eda547744191EA741945f25FbD6050EC0a6EE#code). The contract address is `0x265eda547744191EA741945f25FbD6050EC0a6EE`.
